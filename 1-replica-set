The DaemonSet is used to ensure that your pods are scheduled and running on every single available node while replicaset ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.
One use case can be to run a daemon set for logs collection on each node, such as Fluentd since here replicaset can't ensure that logs are getting collected from each node as
in case of rs desired no of nodes can be scheduled even on a single node.
