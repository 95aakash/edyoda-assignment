we can use the RollingUpdate deployment by including the strategy type under spec type: RollingUpdate in deployment yaml
To update a container's image- kubectl set image deployment/my-deployment mycontainer=mynewimage:tag
But make sure to set imagePullPolicy: "Always" 
kubectl rollout restart deployment myapp
